=================================

======
NOTES:
======
-- Upon looking further into it, Horde is all formatted properly for some reason while Alliance is not.
-- So, starting with Elwynn Forest I will systematically rewrite the guide. 
-- I will use this file in order to keep track of what I have done, what needs to be done, and any other changes made.

======
FIXED:
======
-- 001_Introduction.lua
	- Rewrote the whole thing, shrinking it to a singular string.
	- More tidy in my opinion, easier on the eyes and conveys the features of the guide better.
	- Reworded the credits.
-- 002_DunMorogh.lua 
	- Fixed many grammar and spelling errors.
	- Added color coded instructions throughout the guide.
	- Added proper punctuation.
	- Reworded some instructions to be more clear.

============
IN PROGRESS:
============
-- 002_ElwynnForest.lua
	- Rewrote the first few lines, adding proper punctuation.
	- Added in color codes for the first few lines.
